# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive skeletal mesh optimization system for the rat simulation to improve performance when rendering large numbers of animated characters. The system will use Level of Detail (LOD) techniques, animation time slicing, and vertex animations for distant objects to maintain smooth framerates while preserving visual quality where it matters most.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement LOD (Level of Detail) systems for skeletal meshes, so that nearby rats use high-quality skeletal animations while distant rats use simpler representations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rat is within close distance (< 10 units) THEN the system SHALL use full skeletal animation with all bones
2. WHEN a rat is at medium distance (10-25 units) THEN the system SHALL use reduced bone count skeletal animation
3. WHEN a rat is at far distance (> 25 units) THEN the system SHALL switch to vertex animation or static representation
4. WHEN the camera moves THEN the system SHALL dynamically update LOD levels based on new distances
5. WHEN switching between LOD levels THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without visual popping

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement animation time slicing, so that not all skeletal animations are updated every frame to reduce CPU overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN there are more than 100 animated rats THEN the system SHALL distribute animation updates across multiple frames
2. WHEN a rat is at close distance THEN the system SHALL update its animation every frame
3. WHEN a rat is at medium distance THEN the system SHALL update its animation every 2-3 frames
4. WHEN a rat is at far distance THEN the system SHALL update its animation every 4-8 frames
5. WHEN distributing updates THEN the system SHALL ensure smooth visual appearance without stuttering

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement vertex animations for distant rats, so that far away objects still appear animated without the overhead of skeletal animation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rat is beyond the far distance threshold THEN the system SHALL use pre-baked vertex animations
2. WHEN using vertex animations THEN the system SHALL maintain synchronized timing with skeletal animations
3. WHEN switching from skeletal to vertex animation THEN the system SHALL match the current animation frame
4. WHEN multiple rats use vertex animations THEN the system SHALL batch render them efficiently
5. IF vertex animation data is not available THEN the system SHALL fall back to static poses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want distance-based culling and optimization, so that performance scales well with the number of visible rats.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a rat is beyond maximum render distance THEN the system SHALL cull it from rendering
2. WHEN calculating distances THEN the system SHALL use efficient spatial partitioning to avoid O(nÂ²) calculations
3. WHEN the camera moves significantly THEN the system SHALL recalculate spatial partitions
4. WHEN rats are occluded by terrain or objects THEN the system SHALL apply occlusion culling
5. WHEN multiple rats occupy the same spatial region THEN the system SHALL apply instanced rendering where possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable performance settings, so that the optimization system can be tuned for different hardware capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL load configurable distance thresholds for LOD levels
2. WHEN performance drops below target framerate THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust LOD distances
3. WHEN the user changes quality settings THEN the system SHALL update LOD parameters accordingly
4. WHEN debugging THEN the system SHALL provide visual indicators for current LOD levels
5. IF hardware capabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal default settings

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want memory-efficient animation data management, so that the system doesn't consume excessive memory with multiple animation variants.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading animation data THEN the system SHALL share animation clips between rats at the same LOD level
2. WHEN creating LOD variants THEN the system SHALL generate simplified animations procedurally when possible
3. WHEN rats are not visible THEN the system SHALL unload unnecessary animation data
4. WHEN switching LOD levels THEN the system SHALL reuse existing animation data where applicable
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds thresholds THEN the system SHALL implement LRU cache eviction for animation data
